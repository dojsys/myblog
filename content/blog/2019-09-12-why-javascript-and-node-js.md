I've been a solid C# developer, but ever since **Node.js** came onto the scene, opening the doors of backend programming to JavaScript, the developer demand landscape has changed significantly making a Web app scalable.

**Javascript** is one of most popular programming language for the web. Most of the stuff available in the **npm** is free and open source, significantly decreasing production costs.

One of the biggest benefits of using Node.js is, obviously, using the same language across the whole project. When the frontend and backend speak one language, the time required to build a Web application is reduced.

Using just one language across the whole application helps maintain consistency and improves the Web app’s architecture. 

With only JavaScript used throughout the application, there’s no need to hire additional developers—full-stack JS devs will be more than enough to efficiently build a dynamic Web application.
