**For a typical web app people mostly build these days, my favorite stack is:**

* Database: Postgres, MySql, and MongoDB
* Backend: Node JS with GraphQL or Restful API
* Frontend: Angular 8, React Hooks
* UI Design: Google Material Design and Bootstrap

Most of the choices above are heavily influenced by my past experience with these technologies, except for React. I dealt more with Angular stuff having a bunch of workflow and a set of powerful features that Angular developers will appreciate like the core framework, Angular Material library, and along with the RxJS library.

### Angular
Over the years Angular (NG) is one of the heavily stack I used in developing web apps, but after trying some tutorials on React Hooks, I immediately fell in love with it. 

Although, it depends from project to project based on the requirement and business model. Now a days React Hooks and GraphQL is getting much attention.  

### React
And why I love React, because Hooks is so flexible, best practices and puts you to code DRY.  I like the idea to write less code and do more.

One thing makes me more competent because of ES6, it's a Javascript new syntax and new awesome features to make your code more modern and more readable.

Hooks all the way!
